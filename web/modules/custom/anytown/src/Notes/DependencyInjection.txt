Dependency refers to a class in your code.
Instead of initializing an object in a method, we pass it as an argument/parameter, all that really means is we are passing objects to other objects.
So the place we create the object is done in a separate place from where you use the object (creates dependency).
In most simple form, this happens via classes constructor.
Main advantage is it leads to greater flexibility b/c we don't dictate which specific instance of a class it has to use.

How is dependency injection used in Drupal?
- It enables modules to request services like the db or current user service w/o knowing specifics. This in turn allows Drupal to determine details
based on configuration such as database type.

Constructor injection:
- For constructor dependency injection, any class being passed into the constructor must be an instance of, extend, or implement the same class or
interface specified in the constructor’s type hint.
- Dependencies (services) are supplied as arguments to a class constructor.
- For example, a service querying a third-party API might depend on the http_client service for making HTTP requests, the cache service for caching
responses, and the logger service for logging errors.
Here's an example:
class ExampleService {
  protected $cache;
  protected $http_client;
  protected $logger;

  public function __construct($cache, $http_client, $logger) {
    $this->cache = $cache;
    $this->http_client = $http_client;
    $this->logger = $logger;
  }
}
- To initialize ExampleService, each dependency must be instantiated.
Example:
$cache = new Cache();
$http_client = new Guzzle();
$logger = new Logger();
$example = new ExampleService($cache, $http_client, $logger);
- When accessing a service via the service container, dependencies are automatically initialized. This is the preferred approach in Drupal modules.
 Example:
  $example = Drupal::container('example_service');

Constructor injection via a create() factory method
- Drupal frequently uses a static create() factory method for constructor injection. This is the most common pattern in Drupal modules.
- Example:
$example = ExampleService::create($container);
- Important to know how to use this as opposed to Autowire trait for 2 reasons:
1. There are some services that accept configuration when they're initialized and while it's possible to hardcode that configuration using Autowire, if you need
dynamically calculate the configuration you're going to need to use create() factory method approach.
2. Autowiring is new to Drupal and a lot existing code still use create() approach.

Setting injection:
- Setter injection uses setter methods to set dependencies after object instantiation. This method is less common but useful in specific scenarios.

Dependency injection vs Inheritance (OOP):
- Are very different OOP principles.
- Inheritance = "Is-a" Relationship:
You use inheritance when your class extends another class — meaning it is a specialized version of it. Inheritance expresses hierarchical structure
and shared behavior:
  class Animal {}
  class Dog extends Animal {}
A Dog is an Animal.
It inherits methods and properties from its parent.
- Dependency Injection = "Has-a" Relationship:
Dependency injection expresses collaboration — one class relies on another, but isn’t defined by it:
  class Dog {
    protected $toy;

    public function __construct(Toy $toy) {
      $this->toy = $toy;
    }
  }
Here, Dog has a Toy.
It’s not extending Toy; it’s using it as a dependency.

Autowiring for Dependency Injection:
- Can use class "use Drupal\Core\DependencyInjection\AutowireTrait;" in Drupal classes/services to autowire and use less code when injecting services
into your classes.
