Notes from Drupalize Renders Arrays tutorial:
https://drupalize.me/tutorial/locate-and-identify-existing-services

Find services on api.drupal.org:
- https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/services/11.x

Use Devel to list current site's services:
- Drupal's api doesn't list services from contrib or custom modules so this method would be an option in those cases.
- Must have Devel module installed then run:
drush devel:services

Locate services definitions in files:
- Once you know name of a service, if you want to figure out the PHP class that is associated with it or the service's
arguments, you need to search for the service's name in .yml files.
- Defined as *.services.yml (where * = name of module)

What does this service do?
- Use your IDE to explore the class associated with the service and see which PHP interface the service implements.
- For example, the http_client service (found in core/core.services.yml) is provided by GuzzleHttp\Client class which
implements \GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface. This gives us info to dig into and learn more and find additional documentation.

Use Cases:
- Frequently used in Controllers for business logic and o figure out what information to display on the page. This might
include querying for a list of entities, getting information about the current user, or accessing saved configuration
- Best practice to always use DI to supply services
