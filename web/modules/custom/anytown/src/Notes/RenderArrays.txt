What are properties and elements?
- All renderable arrays have 2 kinds of key/value pairs:
Elements and Properties
- Properties:
Begin with "#" and the values of these properties influence how the array will be rendered to a string.
- Elements:
All keys that don't begin with "#" and the values should be renderable arrays themselves containing properties to
instruct Drupal's theming system how to render the data.
Elements are used to describe individual sections within the array (children arrays) and represent data.

Basic format of a render array:
- Structure of render array is similar to structure of HTML dom, which contains various elements such as H1, p tags
that can be nested within other HTML tags and all these tags can have attributes that provide additional info
about each tag.

3 main ways to describe content as a renderable array:
1. #markup => <p>Hello World!</p>
Provides valid HTML markup directly.
2. #theme => table
Markup provided by a template file (twig). Where the name of the twig template matches the call of the #theme (except
substituting "_" in call for "-" in twig). Ex: "basic-page.html.twig" becomes "basic-page" when called as value for #theme.
3. #type => managed_file
Provides data and properties for a specific type of element. Transformed to #markup or #theme.
Shortcuts for writing more complex elements.
