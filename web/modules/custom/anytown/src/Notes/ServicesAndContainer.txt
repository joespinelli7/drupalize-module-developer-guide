Notes from Drupalize Renders Arrays tutorial:
https://drupalize.me/tutorial/concept-services-and-container


Drupal core includes services for doing common things like accessing the database, sending email, or making HTTP requests.
Generally speaking, almost everything that Drupal does is actually done by one of these objects. In Drupal, these objects
are called services and in order to make working with them easier, they are primarily accessed through the service container.

What are services?
- A service in Drupal is a PHP object that encapsulates functionality or business logic in flexible and reusable fashion.
- Services provide modular, reusable functionalities for easy integration into custom modules.

The service container:
The service container in Drupal acts as a repository and manager for all services.
